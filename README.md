# STM32f767ZI (Cortex-M7) with LwIP (Lightweight IP)

This project aims to create an efficient style of peripheral configuration for the stm32f767zi microcontroller, specifically focusing on avoiding code repetitions intrinsic to HAL and even LL.

## Features

- 216Mhz PLLP (main clock)
- 216Mhz PTP (ethernet)
- 48Mhz PLLQ (USB bus clock)

## TODO
